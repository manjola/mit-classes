          bacteria population and the resistance bacteria population after
          each time step

    Plot the average bacteria population size for both the total bacteria
    population and the antibiotic-resistant bacteria population (y-axis) as a
    function of elapsed time steps (x-axis) on the same plot. You might find
    the helper function make_two_curve_plot helpful

    Args:
        num_bacteria (int): number of ResistantBacteria to create for
            the patient
        max_pop (int): maximum bacteria population for patient
        birth_prob (float int [0-1]): reproduction probability
        death_prob (float in [0, 1]): probability of a bacteria cell dying
        resistant (bool): whether the bacteria initially have
            antibiotic resistance
        mut_prob (float in [0, 1]): mutation probability for the
            ResistantBacteria cells
        num_trials (int): number of simulation runs to execute

    Returns: a tuple of two lists of lists, or two 2D arrays
        populations (list of lists or 2D array): the total number of bacteria
            at each time step for each trial; total_population[i][j] is the
            total population for trial i at time step j
        resistant_pop (list of lists or 2D array): the total number of
            resistant bacteria at each time step for each trial;
            resistant_pop[i][j] is the number of resistant bacteria for
            trial i at time step j
